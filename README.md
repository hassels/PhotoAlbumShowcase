# PhotoAlbumShowcase
Create a console application that displays photo ids and titles in an album. 
The photos are available in this online web service (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos).

Run the Showcase.java file found in the src folder. The program will prompt the user for a number of a photo
album they desire to have in the console. Enter a number and all the photos within that
photo album will be displayed by their id number and title.
